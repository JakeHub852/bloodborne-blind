# Lore and Miscellaneous Observations

## Session 01

- The **Hunter’s Dream** appears timeless and metaphysical — weapons, messengers, and Gehrman all reside there.
- Gehrman seems bound to the dream. His language implies this is not the first cycle.
- **Iosefka** is performing her own medical practices and fears the chaos outside. Her vial feels potent — perhaps unique.
- **Gilbert’s** sickness implies a creeping plague or transformation, possibly from the blood itself.
- **Blood Vials** and **Quicksilver Bullets** are common among both hunters and the deranged — indicating the hunt is widespread and systematic.
- **Hunter Badge** may unlock new equipment — indicates some prior formal structure to the hunt.
- **Madman’s Knowledge** seems to store insight — literal understanding of deeper truths.
- The sewers are riddled with carrion, corpses, and malformed beasts — the underbelly of Yharnam both literally and symbolically.
- The **Hunter Set** found in the sewers suggests many hunters died before me.
- The woman asking about a safe place implies the possibility of shelter, recruitment, or consequences later.

## Session 02

* Insight gained from **Madman’s Knowledge** reveals the metaphysical nature of the hunt and the world.
* The multiplayer bell item unexpectedly summoned another hunter during the approach to the Cleric Beast — shows the interconnectedness of hunters.
* The Tiny Music Box seems important and mysterious, tied to Viola and her mother’s story.
* Hunter Clothes found in the sewers show the presence of previous hunters fallen to the hunt.
