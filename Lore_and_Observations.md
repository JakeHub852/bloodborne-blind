# Lore and Miscellaneous Observations

## Session 01
- The blood ministration ceremony is ritualistic and mysterious.
- The Hunter’s Dream appears after death, suggesting it is some kind of in-between realm.
- Skeletal messengers seem tied to your role as a Hunter.

## Session 02
- The **Cleric Beast** may be a former human turned monstrous — likely a cleric consumed by the plague.
- The Doll and Gehrman suggest a deeper, possibly spiritual or supernatural purpose behind the hunt.
- Gehrman refers to the hunter’s role almost like a duty or burden.
- The **Hunter's Dream** seems reactive — it changes after major events.
- The workshop being locked before and opening later suggests an intentional progression through knowledge or insight.
