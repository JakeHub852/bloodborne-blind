### Session 01

* The “Dream” seems tied to the act of dying — waking up in a graveyard with strange messengers suggests limbo or purgatory.
* Gehrman hints this is a repeating cycle ("You’ll be sure to be in a fine haze about now").
* Iosefka’s refusal to open the door raises suspicion — but she speaks of keeping things clean, perhaps hiding something.
* The city is not just infected — it’s actively hunting its own residents.
* Gilbert mentions the **Healing Church**, hinting they may be the cause or a failed solution.

### Session 02

* The girl (Viola’s daughter) trusts the player enough to hand over the Tiny Music Box, implying her father may be dangerous or missing.
* Viola’s name isn’t said aloud — inferred from the item description and family context.
* The Hunter Set’s item description suggests that hunters are "executioners" — a brutal order hiding behind the pretense of cleansing.
* The beasts are not mindless — some appear to pray or wail.
* Gilbert seems sincere but deteriorating quickly — possibly infected.

### Session 03

* Gilbert’s worsening condition and gifting of the **Flamesprayer** may be his final moment of clarity — suggesting he can’t continue as a guide.
* The girl (Viola’s daughter) gives no acknowledgment that her father is Gascoigne, but the music box’s effect on him confirms it.
* Gascoigne’s transformation reveals the cost of the hunt — even seasoned hunters fall to bloodlust.
* The Music Box hints at a broken family — its use as a weapon is tragic.
* Windows now feel more symbolic — they offer voices of despair or denial, not real connection.
* Central Yharnam seems emptied after Gascoigne’s fall — the hunt continues elsewhere.

### Session 04

* White‑robed **Church Doctors** reveal direct Healing Church enforcement in Cathedral Ward.  
* The strange invisible presence suggests cosmic entities pervade Yharnam.
* Alfred’s hints about Byrgenwerth foreshadow an internal schism within the Healing Church.  
* The **Blood Gem Workshop Tool** links blood manipulation directly to weapon empowerment.  
* The **Monocular** could symbolise striving for clarity amid growing madness.


### Session 05

* Gehrman appears to dwell alone beyond the Workshop — disconnected from the Dream unless summoned.  
* The **Stump of the Nightmare** may hold hidden purpose.  
* Hostility toward “outsiders” is spreading — hints at deeper societal fractures in Yharnam.  
* The Cathedral Ward may serve as a refuge for survivors, suggesting some still maintain hope or order.


### Session 06
* The little girl’s crying after receiving the brooch hints at the grim truth of her fate.  
* The voice in Old Yharnam suggests some enemies have sentience and warning, not blind aggression.  
* The stump activation with the messenger bandage implies a deeper connection between trinkets and the Dream.  
* Other hunters still roam — not all are friendly.
* Iosefka also claims to offer sanctuary to survivors — a second potential safe place.  
* The player is being asked to choose where to send others, raising questions of trust and consequence.
