## Session 01: New Beginnings

**Origin:** Lone Survivor  
**Location:** Iosefka’s Clinic → Hunter’s Dream → Central Yharnam → Sewers

### Summary:
Awoke in a clinic, memories lost. Killed a malformed beast using fists.  
Climbed a ladder and was transported to the **Hunter’s Dream** — a strange graveyard realm with headstones and a derelict workshop.

Received weapons from the messengers:
- **Saw Cleaver**
- **Hunter Pistol**

Met **Gehrman**, an old man in a wheelchair who explained I was now a Hunter and hinted at the dream’s cyclical nature.

Returned to **Iosefka’s Clinic**. Met **Iosefka** through her locked door — she warned me away but gave me a **special blood vial**.

Ventured into **Central Yharnam**, clearing beasts and crazed townsfolk. Collected numerous **blood vials**, **quicksilver bullets**, and found the **Torch**.

Knocked on many doors — most responded with fear or anger. One voice stood out:
- **Gilbert**, a sickly man coughing violently, offered some guidance. He spoke of **blood ministrations**, the **Healing Church**, and mentioned the **Cathedral Ward** as a place of importance.

Also encountered a paranoid woman asking if I knew a safe place — something to return to later.

Chose not to face the **Cleric Beast** yet. Instead, descended into the **Sewers**, encountering giant rats, carrion crows, and mobs of deranged villagers.

Found:
- **Hunter Set (armor)**
- **Saw Hunter Badge**
- **2 Madman’s Knowledge** *(unconsumed)*
- **8 Blood Stone Shards**

Currently unlevelled. Holding **13,000 Blood Echoes** and **0 Insight**.

Going to do one more sweep to check if I missed anything.

Here’s the fully spoiler-safe, clean set of **Session 2** markdowns — strictly what you’ve done and seen so far, no extra info beyond your current progress:
