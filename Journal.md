# Bloodborne Playthrough Journal

## Session 01: Awakening
**Origin:** Military Veteran  
**Location:** Iosefka’s Clinic → Hunter’s Dream  
**Summary:**  
Woke up strapped to a hospital bed with no prior memory. Mentions of Yharnam and blood cocktails.  
A beastly wolf creature approached but was suddenly set aflame.  
Skeletal messengers crawled over me, and a voice said, “They’ve found themselves a Hunter.”  
Awoke in Iosefka’s Clinic, encountered another wolf-beast — tried to fight barehanded and died.  
Woke up in the Hunter’s Dream. Received weapons from messengers:
- **Saw Cleaver**
- **Hunter Pistol**
Returned to the waking world in Iosefka’s Clinic.

Fought through the twisted streets of Central Yharnam, facing hostile townsfolk and beasts.  
Reached the **Cleric Beast** — managed to chip him to ~60% HP before dying.  
Returned to the Hunter’s Dream to find the **Doll** now awake; she can level me up.
