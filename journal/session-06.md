# Session 06: Gunfire and Rooftops

**Origin:** Lone Survivor  
**Location:** Yharnam → Old Yharnam → Hunter’s Dream

### Summary:

- Returned to **Iosefka’s Clinic** — she repeated her offer to shelter humans and mentioned a **reward** for doing so.  
- Revisited NPCs across Yharnam: only the little girl responded. Gave her the **Red Jeweled Brooch**, but she just cried quietly.  
- **Gilbert** was still alive, but said nothing new.  
- Opened the gate to **Old Yharnam** — greeted by an ominous voice warning me to turn back.  
- Proceeded down the main path and was shredded by **gatling gun fire** from above. Died again trying to rush it.  
- Found a side path and spotted an unreachable item in a tower. Jumped rooftops and eventually looped back to the beginning.  
- Realized the item could only be accessed from the direction of the gunner.  
- Found a platform drop near the main path that led to a back route with poison enemies and robed figures (some dropped Blood Stone Shards).  
- Climbed up ladders toward the gunner and got killed quickly in a frontal fight.  
- Discovered another drop to rafters inside a large church. Carefully descended, looting items on the way, including the **Bloody Messenger Head Bandage**.  
- Found two more **Madman’s Knowledge** skulls (not used yet).  
- From the church floor, opened a gate that connected back to the base of the ladder leading to the gunner.  
- Encountered another **hunter** in the church depths — long fight, used lots of vials but defeated him. He wielded a **hunter’s spear**.  
- Attempted the gatling gunner a few more times, but after losing ~6,000 echoes I decided to cut my losses.  
- Returned to the **Hunter’s Dream**.  
- Tried the **bandage** at the stump behind the Workshop — it worked! Messengers now wear the new headgear.
