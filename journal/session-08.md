**Summary:**

Awoke in a prison cell. The door was open, and through a set of broken bars and stairs, I heard an eerie, disembodied female voice echoing through the corridors. Found a woman kneeling by some jars, whispering in prayer — clearly broken by her time here.

Ventured up the main stairway and saw a note suggesting that running was effective. Took the advice, sprinted past several enemies wielding massive sacks, and found a lamp. This new lamp links to an entirely different headstone in the Hunter’s Dream — clearly a distinct region.

After a few attempts at fighting the enemies here, decided this zone might be above my pay grade for now. Returned to Cathedral Ward, then backtracked through Old Yharnam now that the gunman was no longer a threat. Cleared out the route for any missed loot; mostly found standard Blood Stone Shards dropped by enemies.

Final note: the skittering creature from session 7 actually dropped **Twin Blood Stone Shards**, not the standard ones — a higher tier of upgrade material.
