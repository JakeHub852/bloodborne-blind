# Session 04: First Steps Into Cathedral Ward

**Origin:** Lone Survivor  
**Location:** Tomb of Oedon → Cathedral Ward → Old Yharnam Gatehouse

### Summary:

- Left the Cathedral Ward lamp and took the nearby left-hand door. Encountered new tall enemies in white robes wielding scythes — they moved slowly but hit hard.  
- Found a more refined version of the hunter garb in a side room (later identified as **Black Church Set**).  
- While exploring a main gate area, I was suddenly lifted into the air by an unseen force — possibly triggered by my high Insight. It dropped me back unharmed.  
- Continued through more villagers and explored a crypt, eventually pulling a lever that rotated a tomb, revealing a path.  
- In a small graveyard beyond, I met **Alfred**, a polite hunter praying near the graves. He offered me **Fire Paper ×3**, taught me the **Pray** gesture, and mentioned something about the Healing Church and a place called **Byrgenwerth**.  
- Found a chest beyond the rotating tomb containing a workshop item and a gem that slightly boosts physical attack (1.1 %).  
- Picked up two **Madman’s Knowledge** skulls but didn’t use them yet.  
- Lit the lamp in **Old Yharnam** and returned to the Hunter’s Dream to level up. I raised **Vitality** to 20, putting me at **Level 25**.  
- Back in Cathedral Ward: defeated the two white-robed enemies again, then fought a large troll with a brick. Past a portcullis, encountered more enemies from earlier areas.  
- Found a **Monocular** — lets me manually aim my firearm, which might be useful later.  
- Fought another troll, this one wielding a large ball-and-chain. Defeated it and looted **Blood Stone Shard ×5**.  
- Found more shards on other enemies in the area.  
- Discovered a chest at the end of this path with a second blood gem — seems better than the other one (1.1 % vs 0.7 %).  
- Reached a locked gate I couldn’t open yet. Decided to return to the Cathedral Ward lamp and retrace my steps later.

**Session End:** Level 25 | Insight: Unchanged (did not use any items) | Location — Cathedral Ward lamp
