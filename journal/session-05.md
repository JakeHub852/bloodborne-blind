# Session 05: A Safe Place

**Origin:** Lone Survivor  
**Location:** Central Yharnam → Aqueducts → Hunter’s Dream

### Summary:

- Returned to the **Tomb of Oedon** and discovered a woman in a red shawl standing near the lamp. She mentioned that the chapel nearby is a safe place and offered to take in anyone seeking shelter.  
- This seemed to be what the woman in Central Yharnam was hoping to hear.  
- Made my way back through the aqueduct and passed on the message to her through the window.  
- Then returned to the **Hunter’s Dream** via the first lamp encountered after leaving the clinic at the start of the game.  
- While in the Hunter’s Dream, I noticed an area behind the Workshop that I hadn’t seen before. Found **Gehrman** asleep in a wheelchair, overlooking a dark void — he didn’t respond when approached.  
- Nearby was a tree stump marked as part of the nightmare, but it didn’t have any messengers yet.  
- Upgraded my **Saw Cleaver** to **+3** using 8 Blood Stone Shards.  
- Leveled up **Endurance** to **15**, still holding **9 Insight**.  
- Returned to **Cathedral Ward**:  
  - The red-shawled woman seemed grateful for company.  
  - The old woman from Central Yharnam remained hostile and blamed “outsiders” for the current state of things.

**Session End:** Level 26 | Insight: 9 | Location — Cathedral Ward lamp
