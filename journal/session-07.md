**Summary:**

Returned to Old Yharnam to deal with the gunman. After several failed attempts, I eventually took him out by shooting him off his ledge — poetic justice. 

Discovered an item in a tower I couldn’t reach, but found a way by crossing rooftops and navigating rafters. Found another messenger adornment (Messenger Top Hat). 

Summoned Alfred using 1 Insight and took on a large beast drenched in blood. He didn't do much in the fight, but I applied Fire Paper to my weapon and managed to burn the thing down. It dropped a chalice — not sure what it does yet.

Returned to the Hunter’s Dream and upgraded:
- **Hunter Pistol** to +2
- Leveled **Endurance +1** and **Skill +1**
- Now Level: 26 → 28

Took a brief trip through Cathedral Ward and found a new door open. Took an elevator up, encountered a rider in a chair with a machine gun, and ran into some enemies across a bridge.

Spotted a weird, skittering beast that dropped 2 Blood Stone Shards. Fell down rafters to retrieve them. Eventually found myself face to face with a large enemy holding a sack — he hit hard and knocked me out.

Woke up in a prison cell — unfamiliar place, Insight now 12. Somewhere along the way I picked up:
- Messenger Top Hat
- Item to increase max bullets
- Item to increase max vials
- Commoner’s clothing set (now equipped)

Returned to the Hunter’s Dream for now. Unsure what this new prison area means yet, but it feels like a big shift.
